# Solar Family
* Solar system => Solar => Solis (latin word sun).
* Milky way galaxy => a barres spiral galaxy with 2 major arm and 2 minor arm. 
* We are in small, partial arm called orion arm / orion spur between Sagittarius & Perseus arm. 
* 2 to 4 light year in diameter. 
* Orbit around center of our galaxy about $8,28,000 km/h $ which takes 230 million years for one orbit (galactic    year).  
* 27,000 light years away from galactic center.
* According to the IAU, a planet must do three things:

    1. Orbit its host star (In our solar system thatâ€™s the Sun).
    2. Be mostly round.
    3. Be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of similar size near its orbit around the Sun.
* Habitability Zone (Goldilocks Zone) => water stays as liquid in planet => 0.95AU to 1.37AU in our system. 
* Earth lies in the zone; Venus lies in inner edge but as hot planet water gets evaporated; Mars lies in outer edge as cool planet no place for liquid water.
