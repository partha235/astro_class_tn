## Particle creation by black hole
Quantum mechanical effect cause by black hole to create and emit particles as if there were hot bodies with temperature<br>  
$\frac{\hbar k}{2 \pi K} \approx 10^{-6} \frac{M_\odot}{M}\degree K$. 
* k is surface gravity of the black hole.
* $\hbar$ is reduced planck constant.
* M is mass of black hole.
* $M_\odot$ is solar mass.

## hot big bang
 The idea of hot big bang was conceived by Russian Physicist George Gamow in 1940's.It was based on observation that gas expand when get cold and compress when hot.

 In1940's, Russian Physicist George Gamow conceived the hot big band based on the observation that gas expand when cold and compress when hot.** The temperature of the gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of it's constituent particles**. The faster the particle move the higher the temperature. Those particle collide with objects that are not stationary and it lose it's kinetic energy and thus made decrease in temperature. As much the universe expand the particle gets cooler. The temperature in the early universe is inversely proportional to the scalar factor of the universe $T \propto \frac{1}{a}$. The scalar factor **a** is a dimensional quantity describe the how much the size of the universe changes with time. The universe is infinitely hot at the big-bang as scalar factor is zero.<br>
 The universe is mainly made-up of anti-matters and matters. Our surrounding is filled with molecules which are different composition of atoms held together by chemical bond. The chemical bond which hold atoms in molecules breaks at about 500K ($1 \degree K = -272.15 \degree C$), the atom breaks into nuclei and electron around 3000K and those nuclei broke into proton and neutron with approximate of $10^8 K$. As high it goes the neutron and the proton turn to elementary particle called **quarks** at above $10^12 K$. The earlier our solar system was a hot dense mixture of subatomic particle called "the primeval fireball".
