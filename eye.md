# Eye and Light
The eye fixed inside protective bony socket called orbit. The orbit is formed by the cheekbone, the forehead, the temple, and the side of the nose. Lacrimal gland present in orbit is responsible for making tears that cleans the eye and lubricate, moisten it. The tears drain away from the eye through the nasolacrimal duct, which is located at the inner corner of the eye. The extraocular muscles are attached to the white part of the eye called the sclera. This is a strong layer of tissue that covers nearly the entire surface of the eyeball.

The surface of eye including sclera is covered with clear membrane called Conjunctiva. It prevent entering of bacteria and other foreign objects. It has blood vessels which are visible against white sclera.
