# Moon
Moon is the only satellite of our Earth. It is the brightest object is our night sky. 

The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. 

The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.

gravity => 1.6m/s <br>
escape velocity => 2.38 km/sec <br>
diameter ~ 2,160 miles (3,475 kilometers)<br>

he Moon’s outer layer is a thin, rocky crust made up of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, aluminum, and trace elements like potassium, titanium, and uranium.<br>

The Moon’s average distance from Earth is about 238,900 miles (384,400 km). 
* perigee => 226,000 miles (363,000 km) away. 
* apogee => 252,000 miles (405,000 km) away. 

Super Moon => 7% larger <br>

[why not occur](https://en.tutiempo.net/astronomy/sun-earth-moon-3d.html#UTC20240705T0538)

1) Saturn has 146 moon but not collide and while it visible on day and night. are they travel together?

2) how to identify moon's and how long it can?

3) Moon phase explanation.

4) why planet rotate?

5) how shadow form?

6) How we stand on surface?

7) how the color of planets identified and why it was black on sides?

8) see planets through satellite.

9) Is asteroid image or radiation is measured by satellite?

10) No gravity in space but how they form?


Note: Commerce students; interest  in black hole, space; difficult to read but interest in observe, help to read student try; little boring;
