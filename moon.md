# Moon
Moon is the only satellite of our Earth. It is the brightest object is our night sky. 

The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. 

The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.

gravity => 1.6m/s <br>
escape velocity => 2.38 km/sec <br>
diameter ~ 2,160 miles (3,475 kilometers)<br>

he Moon’s outer layer is a thin, rocky crust made up of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, aluminum, and trace elements like potassium, titanium, and uranium.<br>

The Moon’s average distance from Earth is about 238,900 miles (384,400 km). 
* perigee => 226,000 miles (363,000 km) away. 
* apogee => 252,000 miles (405,000 km) away. 

Super Moon => 7% larger <br>

[why not occur](https://en.tutiempo.net/astronomy/sun-earth-moon-3d.html#UTC20240705T0538)

1) Saturn has 146 moon but not collide and while it visible on day and night. are they travel together?

2) how to identify moon's and how long it can?

3) Moon phase explanation.

4) why planet rotate?

5) how shadow form?

6) How we stand on surface?

7) how the color of planets identified and why it was black on sides?

8) see planets through satellite.

9) Is asteroid image or radiation is measured by satellite?

10) No gravity in space but how they form?

11) how black hole detected?

12) how elliptical?

13) how to observe?

14) moon formation 3.8GY G?

15) Trojan asteroids are in Position L4 & L5 . so there is no chance to attract by the planet. They are orbiting the sun at the same speed of the Jupiter?

Note: Commerce students; interest  in black hole, space; difficult to read but interest in observe, help to read student try; little boring;



Why does the sun shine? 

Most people are probably aware that the sun is essentially a nuclear fusion reactor that burns hydrogen gas to release the heat and sun light that sustain all life on earth; but fewer people know that it wouldn’t
shine at all were it not for a remarkable quantum property that allows particles to “walk through walls.” The sun, and indeed all stars in the universe,is able to emit these vast amounts of energy because nuclei of hydrogen
atoms, each composed of just a single positively charged particle called a proton, are able to fuse, and as a result to release energy in the form of the electromagnetic radiation that we call sunlight. Two hydrogen nuclei have to be able to get very close in order to fuse; but the closer they get, the stronger the repulsive force between them becomes, as each carries a positive electric charge and “like” charges repel. In fact, for them
to get close enough to fuse, the particles have to be able to get through the subatomic equivalent of a brick wall: an apparently impenetrable energy barrier. Classical physics3—built upon Isaac Newton’s laws of motion, mechanics and gravity, which describe very well the everyday world of balls, springs, steam engines (and even planets) would predict that this shouldn’t happen; particles should not be able to pass through walls and therefore the sun shouldn’t shine.
